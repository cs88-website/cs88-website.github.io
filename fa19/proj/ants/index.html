    <h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>In this project, you will create a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tower_defense">tower defense</a> game called Ants Vs.
SomeBees.  As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you
can muster.  Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade
your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they
will be vanquished.  Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your
queen will succumb to the bees' wrath.  This game is inspired by PopCap Games'
<a href="http://www.popcap.com/plants-vs-zombies-1">Plants Vs. Zombies</a>.</p>

<p>This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms,
focusing on the material from <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/25-object-oriented-programming.html">Chapter 2.5</a> of Composing Programs. The
project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.</p>

<p>The <a href="ants.zip">ants.zip</a> archive contains several files, but all of your
changes will be made to <code>ants.py</code>.</p>

<p>Certain questions are designated for each partner and are appropriate as solo
questions, in case you choose to divide up the work. Any question not marked as
<code>A</code> or <code>B</code> should be solved together with your partner. Both partners should
read, think about, and understand the solution to all questions. Feel free to
help each other on the solo questions. If you choose to work on the whole
project alone, you must complete all questions yourself.</p>



<p>You can obtain all the files needed for this project by downloading this <a href="ants.zip">zip archive</a>.</p>

<h2>Logistics</h2>

<p>This is a 10-day project. You may work with one other
partner.  You should not share your code with students who are not your
partner or copy from anyone else's solutions.</p>

<!-- <p>In the end, you will submit one project for both partners. The
project is worth 23 points.</p> -->

<p>In the end, you will submit one project for both partners. The
project is worth 25 points. 23 points are
assigned based on correctness for your final submission, and 2 points are for the mid-project checkpoint.</p>

<p>You will turn in the following files:</p>


<ul>
  <li><code>ants.py</code></li>
</ul>


<p>You do not need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the
project. To submit the project, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok --submit</code></pre>

<p>You will be able to view your submissions on the <a
  href="https://okpy.org/">Ok dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.</p>

<p>However, please do <b>not</b> modify any other functions.  Doing so may
result in your code failing our autograder tests. Also, please do not
change any function signatures (names, argument order, or number of
arguments).</p>



<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your
code.  It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate
any problems.</p>

<p>We have provided an <b>autograder</b> called <code>ok</code> to help you with
testing your code and tracking your progress.</p>
<!-- The first time you run
the autograder, you will be asked to <b>log in with your OK account using your web browser</b>. Please do so. Each time you run
<code>ok</code>, it will back up your work and progress on our
servers.</p> -->

<p>The primary purpose of <code>ok</code> is to test your implementations, but there
is a catch. At first, the test cases are <i>locked</i>. To unlock tests,
run the following command from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -u</code></pre>

<p>This command will start an interactive prompt that looks like:</p>

<pre>
=====================================================================
Assignment: Ants Vs. SomeBees
OK, version ...
=====================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlocking tests

At each "? ", type what you would expect the output to be.
Type exit() to quit

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 0 &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1
(cases remaining: 1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Code here
?
</pre>

<p>At the <code>?</code>, you can type what you expect the output to be.
If you are correct, then this test case will be available the next time
you run the autograder.</p>

<p>The idea is to understand <i>conceptually</i> what your program should do
first, before you start writing any code.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked some tests and written some code, you can check
the correctness of your program using the tests that you have
unlocked:</p>

<pre>python3 ok</pre>

<p>Most of the time, you will want to focus on a particular question.
Use the <code>-q</code> option as directed in the problems below.</p>

<p>The <code>tests</code> folder is used to store autograder tests, so make sure
<b>not to modify it</b>. You may lose all your unlocking progress if you
do. If you need to get a fresh copy, you can download the
<a href="ants.zip">zip archive</a> and copy it over, but you
will need to start unlocking from scratch.</p>




<h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h2>


<p>A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns.  In each
turn, new bees may enter the ant colony.  Then, new ants are placed.
Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions: bees
sting ants, and ants throw leaves at bees.  The game ends either when a
bee reaches the ant queen (you lose), or the entire bee flotilla has
been vanquished (you win).</p>

<p><strong>The Colony</strong>.  The colony consists of several places that are chained
together.  The <code>exit</code> of each <code>Place</code> leads to another <code>Place</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Placing Ants</strong>.  There are two constraints that limit ant production.
Placing an ant uses up some amount of the colony's food, a different
amount for each type of ant.  Also, only one ant can occupy each
<code>Place</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Bees</strong>.  When it is time to act, a bee either moves to the <code>exit</code> of
its current <code>Place</code> if no ant blocks its path, or stings an ant that
blocks its path.</p>

<p><strong>Ants</strong>.  Each type of ant takes a different action and requires a
different amount of food to place.  The two most basic ant types are
the <code>HarvesterAnt</code>, which adds one food to the colony during each turn,
and the <code>ThrowerAnt</code>, which throws a leaf at a bee each turn.</p>


<h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2>


<p>Most concepts in the game have a corresponding class that encapsulates
the logic for that concept.  For instance, a <code>Place</code> in the colony
holds insects and connects to other places.  A <code>Bee</code> stings ants and
advances through exits.</p>

<p>The game can be run in two modes: as a text-based game or using a
graphical user interface (GUI).  The game logic is the same in either
case, but the GUI enforces a turn time limit that makes playing the
game more exciting.  The text-based interface is provided for debugging
and development.</p>

<p>The files are separated according to these two modes.  <code>ants.py</code> knows
nothing of graphics or turn time limits.</p>

<p>To start a text-based game, run</p>

<pre><code>python3 ants.py</code></pre>

<p>To start a graphical game, run</p>

<pre><code>python3 ants_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>When you start the graphical version, a new window should appear:</p>

<center>
  <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/gui_explanation.png" style="border: 1px solid #000;"/>
</center>

<p>In the starter implementation, you have unlimited food and your ants
only throw leaves at bees in their current <code>Place</code>.  Try playing the game
anyway!  You'll need to place a lot of <code>ThrowerAnt</code>s (the second type)
in order to keep the bees from reaching your queen.</p>

<p>The game has several options that you will use throughout the project,
which you can view with <code>&#x2d;&#x2d;help</code>.</p>

<pre><code>usage: ants.py [&#x2d;h] [&#x2d;d DIFFICULTY] [&#x2d;w] [&#x2d;&#x2d;food FOOD]

<h2 id="phase-1">Phase 1</h2>



<h3 id="problem-0-0-pts">Problem 0 (0 pts)</h3>


<p>Answer the following questions with your partner after you have read
the <em>entire</em> <code>ants.py</code> file.  If you cannot answer these questions,
read the file again or ask a question on Piazza.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the significance of an insect's <code>armor</code> attribute?  What
  happens when <code>armor</code> reaches 0?</li>
  <li>What are all of the attributes of the <code>Ant</code> class?</li>
  <li>Is the <code>armor</code> attribute of the <code>Ant</code> class an instance attribute or
  class attribute?</li>
  <li>Is the <code>damage</code> attribute of the Ant class an instance attribute or
  class attribute?</li>
  <li>Which class do both <code>Ant</code> and <code>Bee</code> inherit from?</li>
  <li>What attribute(s) do <code>Ant</code> and <code>Bee</code> inherit from their base class?</li>
</ol>

<p>You can test your understanding by running</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 00 &#x2d;u</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-1-2-pts">Problem 1 (2 pts)</h3>


<p>Add food costs and implement harvesters.  Currently, there is no cost
for deploying any type of <code>Ant</code>, and so there is no challenge to the
game. You'll notice that <code>Ant</code> starts out with a base <code>food_cost</code> of
zero. Override this value in each of the subclasses listed below with
the correct costs.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/ant_harvester.gif" /> <br> <code>HarvesterAnt</code></td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/ant_thrower.gif" /> <br> <code>ThrowerAnt</code></td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </td>
</table>

<p>Now there's no way to gather more food!  To fix this issue, implement
the <code>HarvesterAnt</code> class.  A <code>HarvesterAnt</code> is a type of <code>Ant</code> that
adds one food to the <code>colony.food</code> total as its <code>action</code>.</p>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 01 &#x2d;u
python3 ok &#x2d;q 01</code></pre>

<p>Try playing the game again (<code>python3 ants_gui.py</code>).  Once you have placed a
<code>HarvesterAnt</code>, you should accumulate food each turn.  Vanquishing the bees
using the default game setup is now possible.</p>


<h3 id="problem-2-2-pt">Problem 2 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Add code to the <code>Place</code> constructor that tracks entrances.  Right now,
a <code>Place</code> keeps track only of its <code>exit</code>.  We would like a <code>Place</code> to
keep track of its entrance as well.  A <code>Place</code> needs to track only one
<code>entrance</code>.</p>

<p>However, simply passing an entrance to a <code>Place</code> constructor will be
problematic; we would need to have both the exit and the entrance before
creating a <code>Place</code>! (It's a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg">chicken or the
egg</a>
problem.) To get around this problem, we will keep track of entrances
in the following way instead.  The <code>Place</code> constructor should specify
that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A newly created <code>Place</code> always starts with its <code>entrance</code> as <code>None</code>.</li>
  <li>If the <code>Place</code> has an <code>exit</code>, then the <code>exit</code>'s <code>entrance</code> is set to
  that <code>Place</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 02 &#x2d;u
python3 ok &#x2d;q 02</code></pre>


<h2 id="phase-2-water-and-fire-partner-a">Phase 2: Water and Fire (Partner A)</h2>



<h3 id="problem-3a-2-pts">Problem 3A (2 pts)</h3>


<p>Add water to the colony.  Currently there are only two types of places,
the <code>Hive</code> and a basic <code>Place</code>.  To make things more interesting, we're
going to create a new type of <code>Place</code> called <code>Water</code>.</p>

<p>Only an ant that is <code>watersafe</code> can be deployed to a <code>Water</code> place.  In
order to determine whether an <code>Insect</code> is <code>watersafe</code>, add a new
attribute to the <code>Insect</code> class named <code>watersafe</code> that is <code>False</code> by
default.  Since bees can fly, make their <code>watersafe</code> attribute <code>True</code>,
overriding the default.</p>

<p>Now, implement the <code>add_insect</code> method for <code>Water</code>.  First call
<code>Place.add_insect</code> to add the insect, regardless of whether it is
watersafe. Then, if the insect is not watersafe, reduce the insect's
armor to 0 by invoking <code>reduce_armor</code>. Try not to copy and paste code.
Instead, use methods that have already been defined and make use of
inheritance to reuse the functionality of the <code>Place</code> class.</p>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 03A &#x2d;u
python3 ok &#x2d;q 03A</code></pre>

<p>Once you've finished this problem, play a game that includes water.  To
access the <code>wet_layout</code> that includes water, add the <code>&#x2d;&#x2d;water</code> option
(or <code>&#x2d;w</code> for short) when you start the game.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ants_gui.py &#x2d;&#x2d;water</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-4a-3-pts">Problem 4A (3 pts)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>FireAnt</code>.  A <code>FireAnt</code> has a special <code>reduce_armor</code>
method: when the <code>FireAnt</code>'s armor reaches zero or lower, it will
reduce the armor of <em>all</em> <code>Bee</code>s in the same <code>Place</code> as the <code>FireAnt</code>
by its <code>damage</code> attribute (defaults to <code>3</code>).</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/ant_fire.gif" /> <br> <code>FireAnt</code></td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </td>
</table>

<blockquote><p><em>Hint:</em> Damaging a bee may cause it to be removed from its place. If you
iterate over a list, but change the contents of that list at the same time,
you may not visit all the elements.  As the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements">Python
tutorial</a>
suggests, "If you need to modify the sequence you are iterating over while
inside the loop (for example to duplicate selected items), it is recommended
that you first make a copy." You can copy a list by calling the <code>list</code>
constructor or slicing the list from the beginning to the end.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once you've finished implementing the <code>FireAnt</code>, give it a class
attribute <code>implemented</code> with the value <code>True</code>.  This attribute tells
the game that you've added a new type of <code>Ant</code>.</p>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 04A &#x2d;u
python3 ok &#x2d;q 04A</code></pre>

<p>After implementing <code>FireAnt</code>, be sure to test your program by playing a game or
two!  A <code>FireAnt</code> should destroy all co-located Bees when it is stung.  To
start a game with ten food (for easy testing):</p>

<pre><code>python3 ants_gui.py &#x2d;&#x2d;food 10</code></pre>


<h2 id="phase-2-extended-range-partner-b">Phase 2: Extended Range (Partner B)</h2>



<h3 id="problem-3b-2-pts">Problem 3B (2 pts)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>nearest_bee</code> method for the <code>ThrowerAnt</code> class.  In
order for a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> to attack, it must know which bee it should
hit.  The provided implementation will only hit bees in the same
<code>Place</code>.  Your job is to fix it so that a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> will <code>throw_at</code>
the nearest bee in front of it that is not still in the <code>Hive</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>nearest_bee</code> method returns a random <code>Bee</code> from the nearest place that
contains bees. Places are inspected in order by following their <code>entrance</code>
attributes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start from the current <code>Place</code> of the <code>ThrowerAnt</code>.</li>
  <li>For each place, return a random bee if there is any, or consider the
  next place that is stored as the current place's <code>entrance</code>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><em>Hint</em>: The <code>random_or_none</code> function provided in <code>ants.py</code> returns a random
element of a sequence.</p></blockquote>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 03B &#x2d;u
python3 ok &#x2d;q 03B</code></pre>

<p>After implementing <code>nearest_bee</code>, a <code>ThrowerAnt</code> should be able to
<code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> in front of it that is not still in the <code>Hive</code>.
Make sure that your ants do the right thing! To start a game with ten
food (for easy testing):</p>

<pre><code>python3 ants_gui.py &#x2d;&#x2d;food 10</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-4b-3-pts">Problem 4B (3 pts)</h3>


<p>Now that the <code>ThrowerAnt</code> has been completed, implement two subclasses
of <code>ThrowerAnt</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>LongThrower</code> can only <code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> that is found after
  following at least 5 <code>entrance</code> transitions.  So the <code>LongThrower</code>
  can't hit <code>Bee</code>s that are in the same <code>Place</code> as it or the first 4
  <code>Place</code>s in front of it. If there are two <code>Bees</code>, one too close to
  the <code>LongThrower</code> and the other within its range, the <code>LongThrower</code>
  should throw past the closer <code>Bee</code>, instead targeting the farther
  one, which is within its range.</li>
  <li>The <code>ShortThrower</code> can only <code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> that is found after
  following at most 3 <code>entrance</code> transitions.  So the <code>ShortThrower</code>
  can only hit <code>Bee</code>s in the same <code>Place</code> as it and 3 <code>Place</code>s in front
  of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these specialized throwers can <code>throw_at</code> a <code>Bee</code> that is
exactly 4 <code>Place</code>s away.  Placing a single one of these (and no other
ants) should never win a default game.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/ant_shortthrower.gif" /> <br>
      <code>ShortThrower</code></td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/ant_longthrower.gif" /> <br> <code>LongThrower</code></td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>A good way to approach the implementation to <code>ShortThrower</code> and <code>LongThrower</code>
is to have it inherit the <code>nearest_bee</code> method from the base <code>ThrowerAnt</code>
class. The logic of chosing which bee a thrower ant will attack is essentially
the same, except the <code>ShortThrower</code> and <code>LongThrower</code> ants have maximum and
minimum ranges, respectively.</p>

<p>To implement these behaviors, you may need to modify the <code>nearest_bee</code> method
to reference <code>min_range</code> and <code>max_range</code> attributes, and only return a bee that
is in range.</p>

<p>The <code>ThrowerAnt</code> has no minimum or maximum range, so make sure that its
<code>min_range</code> and <code>max_range</code> attributes should reflect that.  Then, implement
the subclasses <code>LongThrower</code> and <code>ShortThrower</code> with appropriately constrained
ranges and correct food costs.</p>

<p>Don't forget to set the <code>implemented</code> class attribute of <code>LongThrower</code> and
<code>ShortThrower</code> to <code>True</code>.</p>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<code>&#x2d;d insane</code> if you want a real challenge!  If the bees are too numerous to
vanquish, you might need to create some new ants.</p>


<h3 id="problem-5a-2-pt">Problem 5A (2 pt)</h3>


<p>We are going to add some protection to our glorious <code>AntColony</code> by implementing
the <code>WallAnt</code>, which is an ant that does nothing each turn.  A <code>WallAnt</code> is
useful because it has a large <code>armor</code> value.</p>

<table class="ant">

    <td><b>Class</b></td>

<p>Unlike with previous ants, we have not provided you with a class header.
Implement the <code>WallAnt</code> class from scratch. Give it a class attribute <code>name</code>

<p>Implement the <code>NinjaAnt</code>, which damages all <code>Bee</code>s that pass by, but can never
be stung.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/ant_ninja.gif" /> <br> <code>NinjaAnt</code></td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </td>
</table>

<p>A <code>NinjaAnt</code> does not block the path of a <code>Bee</code> that flies by.  To implement
this behavior, first modify the <code>Ant</code> class to include a new class attribute
<code>blocks_path</code> that is <code>True</code> by default.  Set the value of <code>blocks_path</code> to
<code>False</code> in the <code>NinjaAnt</code> class.</p>

<p>Second, modify the <code>Bee</code>'s method <code>blocked</code> to return <code>False</code> if either
there is no <code>Ant</code> in the <code>Bee</code>'s <code>place</code> or if there is an <code>Ant</code>, but
its <code>blocks_path</code> attribute is <code>False</code>.  Now <code>Bee</code>s will just fly past
<code>NinjaAnt</code>s.</p>

<p>Finally, we want to make the <code>NinjaAnt</code> damage all <code>Bee</code>'s that fly past.
Implement the <code>action</code> method in <code>NinjaAnt</code> to reduce the armor of all <code>Bee</code>s
in the same <code>place</code> as the <code>NinjaAnt</code> by its <code>damage</code> attribute. Similar to
the <code>FireAnt</code>, you must iterate over a list of bees that may change.</p>

<p>Currently there are no ants that can be placed on <code>Water</code>.  Implement
the <code>ScubaThrower</code>, which is a subclass of <code>ThrowerAnt</code> that is more
costly and <code>watersafe</code>, but otherwise identical to its base class.
A <code>ScubaThrower</code> should not lose its armor when placed in <code>Water</code>.</p>

<table class="ant">

    <td>5</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Unlike with previous ants, we have not provided you with a class header.
Implement the <code>ScubaThrower</code> class from scratch. Give it a class attribute
<code>name</code> with the value <code>&#x27;Scuba&#x27;</code> (so that the graphics work) and a class
attribute <code>implemented</code> with the value <code>True</code> (so that you can use it in a
game).</p>

<p>We will now implement the new offensive unit called the <code>HungryAnt</code>, which will
select a random <code>Bee</code> from its <code>place</code> and eat it whole.  After
eating a <code>Bee</code>, it must spend 3 turns digesting before eating again.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>

    <td>4</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </td>
</table>

<p>Give <code>HungryAnt</code> a <code>time_to_digest</code> class attribute that holds the number of
turns that it takes a <code>HungryAnt</code> to digest (default to 3).  Also, give each
<code>HungryAnt</code> an instance attribute <code>digesting</code> that counts the number of turns
it has left to digest (default is 0, since it hasn't eaten anything at the
beginning).</p>

<p>Implement the <code>action</code> method of the <code>HungryAnt</code> to check if it's digesting; if
so, decrement its <code>digesting</code> counter.  Otherwise, eat a random <code>Bee</code> in its
<code>place</code> by reducing the <code>Bee</code>'s armor to 0 and restart the <code>digesting</code> timer.</p>

<h3 id="problem-7-4-pts">Problem 7 (4 pts)</h3>


<p>Right now, our ants are quite frail. We'd like to provide a way to help them
last longer against the onslaught of the bees. Enter the <code>BodyguardAnt</code>.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/ant_weeds.gif" /> <br> <code>BodyguardAnt</code></td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>A <code>BodyguardAnt</code> differs from a normal ant because it is a <code>container</code>; it can
contain another ant and protect it, all in one <code>Place</code>. When a <code>Bee</code> stings the
ant in a <code>Place</code> where one ant contains another, only the container is
damanged. The ant inside the container can still perform its original action.
If the container perishes, the contained ant still remains in the place (and
can then be damaged).</p>

<p>Each <code>BodyguardAnt</code> has an instance attribute <code>ant</code> that stores the ant it
contains. It initially starts off as <code>None</code>, to indicate that no ant is being
protected. The <code>contain_ant</code> method takes an <code>Ant</code> argument and sets the
bodyguard's <code>ant</code> instance attribute.</p>

<p>You will need to make modifications throughout your program so that a container
and its contained ant can both occupy the place at the same time (a maximum of
two ants per place), but only if exactly one is a <code>container</code>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add an <code>Ant.container</code> class attribute that indicates whether a
  subclass of <code>Ant</code> is a container.  For all <code>Ant</code>
  instances, except for <code>BodyguardAnt</code> instances, <code>container</code> should be
  <code>False</code>.  The <code>BodyguardAnt.container</code> attribute should be <code>True</code>.</li>
  <li><p>Add a method <code>Ant.can_contain</code> that takes the <code>other</code> ant as an
  argument and returns <code>True</code> when:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>This ant is a container.</li>
    <li>This ant does not already contain another ant.</li>
    <li>The other ant is not a container.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p>Modify <code>Place.add_insect</code> to allow a container and a non-container ant
  to occupy the same place according to the following rules:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the <code>ant</code> currently occupying a <code>Place</code> can contain the <code>insect</code>
    (an <code>Ant</code>) passed to <code>add_insect</code>, then it does.</li>
    <li>If the <code>insect</code> (an <code>Ant</code>) passed to <code>add_insect</code> can contain the
    <code>ant</code> currently occupying a <code>Place</code>, then it does. Also,
    set the <code>Place</code>'s <code>ant</code> to be the container insect.</li>
    <li>If neither <code>Ant</code> can contain the other, raise the same
    <code>AssertionError</code> as before.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<h3 id="problem-8-1-pts">Problem 8 (1 pts)</h3>


<p>The <code>BodyguardAnt</code> provides great defense, but they say the best defense is a
good offense.  The <code>TankAnt</code> is a container that protects an ant in its place
and also deals 1 damage to all bees in its place each turn.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/ant_weeds.gif" /> <br> <code>TankAnt</code></td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>You should not need to modify any code outside of the <code>TankAnt</code> class. If you
find yourself needing to make changes elsewhere, look for a way to write your
code for the previous question such that it applies not just to <code>BodyguardAnt</code>
and <code>TankAnt</code> objects, but to <code>container</code> ants in general.</p>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 08 &#x2d;u
python3 ok &#x2d;q 08</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-9-4-pts">Problem 9 (4 pts)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>QueenAnt</code>. The queen is a waterproof <code>ScubaThrower</code> that
inspires her fellow ants through her bravery. The QueenAnt doubles the damage
of all the ants behind her each time she performs an action. Once an ant's
damage has been doubled, it is <em>not</em> doubled again on subsequent turns.</p>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/ant_queen.gif" /> <br> <code>QueenAnt</code></td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>However, with great power comes great responsibility.  The <code>QueenAnt</code> is
governed by three special rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the queen ever has its armor reduced to 0, the bees win. The bees also
  still win if any bee reaches the end of a tunnel.</li>
  <li>There can be only one true queen. Any queen instantiated beyond the first
  one is an impostor, and should have its armor reduced to 0 upon taking its
  first action, without doubling any ant's damage or throwing anything. If an
  impostor dies, the game should still continue as normal.</li>
  <li>The true (first) queen cannot be removed. Attempts to remove the queen
  should have no effect (but should not cause an error). You will need to
  modify the <code>remove_insect</code> method of <code>Place</code> to enforce this condition.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Call <code>bees_win()</code> to signal to the simulator that the game is over.</li>
  <li>You can find each <code>Place</code> in a tunnel behind the <code>QueenAnt</code> by starting at
  the ant's <code>place.exit</code> and then repeatedly following its <code>exit</code>.</li>
  <li>To detect whether a <code>Place</code> is at the end of a tunnel, check whether
  its <code>exit</code> is <code>None</code>.</li>
  <li>To make sure that you don't double the damage of the same ant twice,
  maintain a list of all the ants that have been doubled.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="extra-credit-2-pts">Extra Credit (2 pts)</h3>


<p>Implement two final thrower ants that do no damage, but instead replace
the <code>action</code> method of a <code>Bee</code> instance that they <code>throw_at</code> with a new
method that alters the <code>Bee</code>'s behavior for some duration.</p>

<p>We will be implementing two new ants that subclass <code>ThrowerAnt</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>SlowThrower</code> applies a slow effect for 3 turns.</li>
  <li><code>StunThrower</code> applies a stun effect for 1 turn.</li>
</ul>

<table class="ant">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Class</b></td>
    <td><b>Food</b></td>
    <td><b>Armor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/ant_freeze.gif" /> <br> <code>SlowThrower</code></td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/ant_stun.gif" /> <br> <code>StunThrower</code></td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In order to complete the implementations of these two ants, you will
need to set their class attributes appropriately and implement the
following three functions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>make_slow</code> takes an <code>action</code> method and returns a new <code>action</code>
  method which performs the original action on turns where
  <code>colony.time</code> is even and does nothing on other turns.</li>
  <li><code>make_stun</code> takes an <code>action</code> method and returns a new <code>action</code>
  method which does nothing.</li>
  <li><code>apply_effect</code> takes an <code>effect</code> (either <code>make_slow</code> or
  <code>make_stun</code>), a <code>bee</code>, and a <code>duration</code>.  It then replaces the bee's
  action with a new action method that will call the affected action
  for <code>duration</code> turns and then will go back to calling the original
  action every turn.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can run some provided tests, but they are not exhaustive:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q EC &#x2d;u
python3 ok &#x2d;q EC</code></pre>

<p>Make sure to test your code!  Your code should be able to apply
multiple effects on a target; each new effect applies to the current
(possibly affected) action method of the bee.</p>

<p><strong>You are now done with the project!</strong>  If you haven't yet, you should try
playing the game! There are two GUIs that you can use. The first is an older,
but tried-and-true interface that we have been using over the past few years.
The command to run it is:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ants_gui.py [&#x2d;h] [&#x2d;d DIFFICULTY] [&#x2d;w] [&#x2d;&#x2d;food FOOD]</code></pre>

<p>We've also been developing a new browser GUI that we're looking to phase in.
It's still in development, but we will continuously push updates to it, which
it will automatically download when it runs. The command to run it is:</p>

<pre><code>python3 gui.py [&#x2d;h] [&#x2d;d DIFFICULTY] [&#x2d;w] [&#x2d;&#x2d;food FOOD]</code></pre>
