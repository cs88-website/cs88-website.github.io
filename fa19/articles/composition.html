      <h1>Composition</h1>
    </div>

     <p>The ease by which other <em>people</em> can read and understand a program
(often called "readability" in software engineering) is perhaps the
most important quality of a program. Readable programs are used and
extended by others, sometimes for decades. For this reason, we often
repeat in 61A that programs are written to be read by humans, and only
incidentally to be interpreted by computers.</p>

<p>A program is composed well if it is concise, well-named, understandable, and
easy to follow.</p>

<p>Excellent composition does not mean adhering strictly to prescribed
style conventions.  There are many ways to program well, just as there
are many styles of effective communication.  However, the following
guiding principles universally lead to better composition of programs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Names</strong>. To a computer, names are arbitrary symbols: "xegyawebpi"
  and "foo" are just as meaningful as "tally" and "denominator".  To
  humans, comprehensible names aid immensely in comprehending programs.
  Choose names for your functions and values that indicate their use,
  purpose, and meaning.  See the lecture notes section on
  <a href="http://www.composingprograms.com/pages/13-defining-new-functions.html#choosing-names">choosing names</a>
  for more suggestions.</li>
  <li><strong>Functions</strong>. Functions are our primary mechanism for abstraction,
  and so each function should ideally have a single job that can be
  used throughout a program.  When given the choice between calling a
  function or copying and pasting its body, strive to call the function
  and maintain abstraction in your program.  See the lecture notes
  section on
  <a href="http://www.composingprograms.com/pages/14-designing-functions.html#designing-functions">composing functions</a>
  for more suggestions.</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose</strong>. Each line of code in a program should have a purpose.
  Statements should be removed if they no longer have any effect
  (perhaps because they were useful for a previous version of the
  program, but are no longer needed). Large blocks of unused code, even
  when turned into comments, are confusing to readers.  Feel free to
  keep your old implementations in a separate file for your own use,
  but don't turn them in as your finished product.</li>
  <li><strong>Brevity</strong>. An idea expressed in four lines of code is often clearer
  than the same idea expressed in forty.  You do not need to try to
  minimize the length of your program, but look for opportunities to
  reduce the size of your program substantially by reusing functions
  you have already defined.</li>
