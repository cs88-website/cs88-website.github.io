     <h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>


<p>CS 88 is a connector for Data 8 that is 
designed for students who would like a more complete introduction to
Computer Science. We will cover a
variety of topics such as functional programming, data abstraction, 
object-oriented programming, and program complexity. 
This course will be taught primarily in Python. 
However, we are interested in teaching you foundational programming ideas, not
just how to use one particular programming language.
Once you have learned the essence of programming and the concepts that
appear in various forms in programming languages, you will be able to
pick up other languages and other programming concepts rapidly.</p>

<p>The material for this course has significant overlap with CS 61A. We do not cover
the interpretation section of CS61A. If you are certain that you want to
major or minor in Computer Science, CS 61A is the right introductory
course.  You can take CS 61A for credit after having taken CS 88. 
However, you cannot take CS 88 for credit after having taken CS 61A.
Data 8 and CS 88 together satisfy the knowledge prerequisite for CS 61B.</p>


<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>


<p>You must be currently enrolled in or have taken Data 8.
There is no formal programming-related prerequisite for 
CS 88.  You do not need to be familiar with any particular
programming language.</p>

<h2 id="course-format">Course Format</h2>


<p><strong>Lecture:</strong> There will be one 50-minute lecture per week.</p>

<p><strong>Labs:</strong> This course also includes one weekly two-hour lab section.
Labs will be run by a TA and are also mandatory.
Labs are short, relatively simple exercises designed to introduce a new topic. 
Participation in lab is essential and required. Labs will be graded on completion.</p>

<p><strong>Homework:</strong> There will be weekly homework assignments that will be more involved and 
are meant to illustrate and explore new topics.  You are encouraged to discuss the
homework with other students, but your final solution should be developed alone.
Homework will be graded on accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Projects:</strong> There will be 3 projects intended to teach you how to
combine ideas from the course in interesting ways. 
You are encouraged to complete projects with a partner but may 
work alone if you prefer. Projects will be graded on accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Exams:</strong> This course will have one midterm and a final. 
The Midterm will held in the evening and is two hours long to give you more time
than lecture would allow. You will be allowed to bring a
fixed number of pages of notes to each exam. Details of this policy
will be released as the exams approach.</p>

<p><strong>Office Hours:</strong> Attending office hours is another great way to succeed in
this course. Office hours are held by TAs and the instructor each week. An 
office hours schedule appears on the course website.
In office hours, you can ask questions about the material, receive guidance on
assignments, work with peers and course staff in a small group setting, find
project partners, and learn about computer science at Berkeley.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Sections:</strong> In addition to the weekly class meetings, the course
will include optional events such as review sessions that are designed to help 
you master the course material and complete the assignments. 
Details of these events will be announced as they approach.</p>


<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>


<p>The online textbook for the course is <a href="http://composingprograms.com">Composing Programs</a>, which was
created specifically for CS61A but is also the best basis for this course. 
Readings for each lecture appear in the course schedule. 
We will be jumping around a little due to the data-centric
orientation of the course. You should complete the readings before
attending lecture.</p>

<p>In addition, the course website and Piazza will contain additional links to 
guides, handouts, and practice materials available for the course.</p>


<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>


<p>Your course grade is computed using a point system with a total of 230
points, with the following distribution.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Midterm</strong>: 20%</li>
  <li><strong>Final</strong>: 20%</li>
  <li><strong>Projects</strong>: 30%</li>
  <li><strong>Weekly Homework</strong>: 20%</li>
  <li><strong>Weekly Labs</strong>: 10%</li>
  <li><strong>EPA</strong> (Effort, Participation, Altruism)</li>
</ul>

<p>The EPA points will be determined at the end of the semester and 
will only serve to boost your grade.</p>


<h2 id="learning-cooperatively">Learning Cooperatively</h2>


<p>With the obvious exception of exams and take-home quizzes, we encourage you to
discuss <em>all</em> of the course activities with your friends and classmates as you
are working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work
with others than if you do not.  Ask questions, answer questions, and share
ideas liberally.</p>

<p>Since you're working collaboratively, keep your project partner and TA
informed.  If some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course
for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason,
please don't just disappear silently!  You should inform your project partner,
so that nobody is depending on you to do something you can't finish.</p>


<h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h2>


<p>Cooperation has a limit, however, and in CS 88 that limit is sharing code. Feel
free to discuss the problems with others beforehand, but not the code that
solves them. Homework and projects can be completed in pairs. You can share
everything with your partner. Do not share your code with anyone but your
partner, and do not read anyone but your partner's code. Do not post your
solutions online. Do not use pastebin or github, which post your work publicly
by default. Do not read solutions that you find online. Write your own programs
and keep them to yourself.</p>

<p>If you find a solution online, please email a link to that solution to the instructor.</p>

<p>We expect you to hand in your own work, take your own tests, and complete your
own projects.  The assignments and evaluations are structured to help you
learn, which is why you're here. The course staff works hard to put together
this course, and we ask in return that you respect the integrity of the course
by not misrepresenting your work.</p>

<p>The EECS Department Policy on Academic Dishonesty says, "Copying all or part of
another person's work, or using reference materials not specifically allowed,
are forms of cheating and will not be tolerated." The policy statement goes on
to explain the penalties for cheating, which range from a zero grade for the
test up to dismissal from the University, for a second offense.</p>

<p>Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help.  You are not alone in
this course!  The TAs, lab assistants, and instructor are all here to help you
succeed.  If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the
projects, you won't need to copy any answers.</p>


<h2 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h2>


<p>You will have 2 slip days that you can use for any assignments (homework, labs, projects). These 
must be used as days and cannot be broken
down into smaller units, such as hours or minutes. To use a slip day, please
submit a request <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJs6BC5chjEE8z-fB3CtbDwuRIz8oLTXIgogyHvPE2GoWyog/viewform">here</a>. Using slip days will essentially extend the due date for a given assignment by the number of slip days you want to use. For homework and labs, there is no credit for late submissions. For projects, 2 points will be deducted for each day the project is late.</p>


<h2 id="a-parting-thought">A Parting Thought</h2>


<p>The main goal of this course is to help you the learn and enjoy the material.
Please don't hesitate to reach out to the staff for any questions or concerns. 
We are here to help you however we can. Welcome to CS 88!</p>
