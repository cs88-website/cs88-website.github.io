UNIX commands
=============

Directories
-----------
* `ls`: list the files and folders inside of the current
  directory
* `mkdir`: make a new directory. For example, `mkdir lab0` creates a
   directory called `lab0`
* `cd`: change directories. For example, `cd lab0` changes directories
  to `lab0`
* `rm -r`: remove a specified directory. For
  example, `rm -r lab0` removes the `lab0` directory and all files
  and subdirectories inside it.

Files
-----
* `cat`: displays the contents of a file on the screen. For
  example, `cat unix.txt` shows the contents of the file `unix.txt`
* `mv`: moves a file/directory to another file/directory. For example,
  `mv file1 file2` moves the contents of `file1` into
  a (possibly new) file called `file2`. When moving one file to
  another, we are effectively renaming the file!
* `cp`: copies a file to another file/directory. For
  example, `cp file1 file2` copies the contents of `file1` into a
  file named `file2`.
* `rm`: removes a file. For example, `rm file1` deletes the
  file called `file1`.

Miscellaneous
-------------
* `echo`: displays words on the screen
* `man`: displays manual pages for a specified command
